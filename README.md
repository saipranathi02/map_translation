Map Translation is a machine learning project aimed at translating satellite images to Google Map images and vice versa. This innovative project leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for the translation process. It also features a mobile application with a user-friendly interface built using Flutter, and Firebase for storing generated images and user details.

Features:

Image Translation: Convert satellite images to Google Map images and vice versa using a trained machine learning model.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Flutter, the app provides a smooth user experience.
Firebase Integration: Store generated images and user information in a secure database.
High Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test dataset.
